# Files Sharing

>  
> FILES SHARING VERSION 2 JUST RELEASED
>  


## Description

This PHP application based on Laravel 10.9 allows to share files like Wetransfer. You may install it **on your own server**. It **does not require** any database system, it works with JSON files into the storage folder. It is **multilingual** and comes with english, french, german and korean translations for now. You're welcome to help translating the app.

This application provides two links per bundle :
- a bundle preview link : you can send this link to your recipients who will see the bundle content. For example: http://yourdomain/bundle/dda2d646b6746b96ea9b?auth=965242. The recipient can see all the files of the bundle and download the bundle as a ZIP archive.
- a bundle download link : you can send this link yo your recipients who will download all the files of the bundle at once (without any preview). For example: http://yourdomain/bundle/dda2d646b6746b96ea9b/download?auth=965242.

Each of these links comes with an authorization code. This code is the same for the preview and the download links.

The application also comes with a Laravel Artisan command as a background task who will physically remove expired bundle files of the storage disk. This command is configured to run every five minutes among the Laravel scheduled commands.

## Features

- **uploader access permission**: IP based or login/password
- **bundle's settings**: title, description, expiration date, number max of downloads, password...
- upload one or more files via drag and drop or via browsing your filesystem
- ability to keep adding files to the bundle days later
- sharing link with bundle content preview
- download rate limiter
- ability to download the entire bundle as ZIP archive (password protected when applicable)
- direct download link (doesn't preview the bundle content)
- garbage collector which removes the expired bundles as a background task
- multilingual (EN, FR, DE and KR)
- easy installation, **no database required**
- secured by tokens, authentication codes and non-publicly-accessible files

- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

Plus:
- JSON PHP Extension (included after PHP 5.2+)

- SQLite

The application also uses:
- http://www.dropzonejs.com/
- https://alpinejs.dev/
- https://tailwindcss.com/
- https://momentjs.com/
- https://axios-http.com/
- https://lodash.com/

## Installation

### Docker

You may now install FileSharing via Docker. 
See [https://hub.docker.com/r/axeloz/filesharing](https://hub.docker.com/r/axeloz/filesharing)

```
docker run -d \
-p 8080:80 \
-v <local_path>:/app/storage/content \
--name filesharing \
-e APP_NAME="FileSharing" \
-e APP_URL="<your_url>" \
-e ASSET_URL="<your_asset_url>" \
-e UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE="1G" \
-e APP_TIMEZONE="Europe/Paris" \
-e UPLOAD_PREVENT_DUPLICATES=true \
-e HASH_MAX_FILESIZE="1G" \
-e UPLOAD_MAX_FILES=100 \
-e LIMIT_DOWNLOAD_RATE="100K" \
axeloz/filesharing:latest
```
- use the `-v` option to bind your local storage to the docker instance (persisting data)
- adapt the `-p` option to listen to the port you need
- you may pass env variables with the `-e` option
- you can use a reverse proxy for SSL termination (example: nginx)

Simple config for Nginx:

```
server {
	server_name filesharing.box.webinno.fr;
	charset utf-8;

	location / {
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_set_header   X-Scheme $scheme;
		proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
	}

	listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
	listen 443 ssl http2;
	ssl_certificate [...]
	ssl_certificate_key [...]
}
```

You can also use in docker compose with the following template:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: axeloz/filesharing:latest
    environment:
      UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE: "1G"
      UPLOAD_MAX_FILES: "100"
      UPLOAD_LIMIT_IPS: "127.0.0.1"
      UPLOAD_PREVENT_DUPLICATES: true
      HASH_MAX_FILESIZE: "1G"
      LIMIT_DOWNLOAD_RATE: "1M"
    volumes:
      - files_v:/app/storage/content
    ports:
      - 8080:80

volumes:
  files_v:
    driver: local
```


### Standalone

- configure your domain name. For example: files.yourdomain.com
- clone the repo or download the sources into the webroot folder
- configure your webserver to point your domain name to the `./public` folder
- run `composer install`
- run `yarn --production` (or `npm install --production`)
- run `yarn build` (or `npm run build`)
- make sure that the PHP process has write permission on the `./storage` folder
- generate the Laravel KEY: `php artisan key:generate`
- run `cp .env.example .env` and edit `.env` to fit your needs
- (optional) you may create your first user `php artisan fs:user:create`
- start the Laravel scheduler (it will delete expired bundles of the storage). For example `* * * * * /usr/bin/php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`
- (optional) to purge bundles manually, run `php artisan fs:bundle:purge`


Use your browser to navigate to your domain name (example: files.yourdomain.com) and **that's it**.

## Configuration

In order to configure your application, copy the .env.example file into .env. Then edit the .env file.

| Configuration | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `APP_NAME`    | the title of the application |
| `APP_ENV`     | change this to `production` when in production (`local` otherwise) |
| `APP_DEBUG` | change this to `false` when in production (`true` otherwise) |
| `APP_TIMEZONE` | change this to your current timezone |
| `APP_LOCALE` | change this to "fr", "en", "de" or "kr" |
| `UPLOAD_PREVENT_DUPLICATES` | Should the app block duplicate files (true / false) |
| `HASH_MAX_FILESIZE`| max size for hashing file to check for duplicate files. If files are bigger than limit, they will not be hashed. Find the best value for better cpu / memory consumption |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` | (*optional*) maximal number of files per bundle |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE` | (*optional*) change this to the value you want (K, M, G, T, ...). Attention : you must configure your PHP settings too (`post_max_size`, `upload_max_filesize` and `memory_limit`). When missing, using PHP lowest configuration |
| `UPLOAD_LIMIT_IPS` | (*optional*) a comma separated list of IPs from which you may upload files. Different formats are supported : Full IP address (192.168.10.2), Wildcard format (192.168.10.*), CIDR Format (192.168.10/24 or 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or Start-end IP (192.168.10.0-192.168.10.10). When missing, filtering is disabled. |
| `LIMIT_DOWNLOAD_RATE` | (*optional*) if set, limit the download rate. For instance, you may set `LIMIT_DOWNLOAD_RATE=100K` to limit download rate to 100Ko/s |


## Authentication

You may provide a list of IPs to limit access to the upload feature.  
Or you can create users with login/password credentials.   
You can also **mix the two methods**.

>  
> Warning: if your leave the `UPLOAD_LIMIT_IPS` empty and you don't create users, the upload will be publicly accessible
>  

## Known issues

1.) If you are using Nginx, you might be required to do additional setup in order to increase the upload max size. Check the Nginx's documentation for `client_max_body_size`.

2.) Set Folder to apache2/nginx user `chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/app/dir`

2.1) Set correct files permission `find /path/to/app/dir -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;` 

2.2) Set correct folder permission `find /path/to/app/dir -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;`

## Development

If your want to modify the sources, you can use the Laravel Mix features:
- configure your domain name. For example: files.yourdomain.com
- clone the repo or download the sources into the webroot folder
- configure your webserver to point your domain name to the public/ folder
- run a `composer install`
- run a `yarn install`
- run a `yarn dev` in order to recompile the assets when changed

## Roadmap / Ideas / Improvements

There are many ideas to come. You are welcome to **participate**.
- add PHP unit testing
- more testing on heavy files
- background process for creating Zips asynchronously after completion of the bundle
- invitation to external users to upload file into existing bundle 
- customizable / white labeling (logo, name, terms of service, footer ...)
